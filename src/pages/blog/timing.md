Conventional startup dogma states that a startup's success is, fundamentally, a 
function of market timing. It's normal to be washed over by 
the giddiness of a "good" idea; however, no matter how "good" your idea is, 
you're still at the mercy of timing your venture right. 

In 2022, I started working on [Reshape](https://reshape-io.github.io/) with a 
good friend of mine. Our vision for Reshape was a data analytics environment where
the only language you needed to know was English. We wanted all knowledge 
workers to be able to get insights from there data
without being restricted by the data science skills required. After speaking to 
potential customers, we determined that there was a need for such a product, but 
we were constantly feeling bound by the limits of our domain knowledge and the 
current landscape of natural language processing technology. So we quit after 
a couple months :(.

A couple weeks ago, I came across [Pretzel](https://withpretzel.com/): 
an open source & AI-native replacement for Juypter Notebooks.

Sound familiar? Yea, sounds a lot like Reshape, right?

I still think Reshape was a great idea with 
tons of potential, but unfortunately the technology necessary wasn't 
available at the scale we needed to successfully execute our vision. 
This is not to say you should wait until the conditions are right to launch or 
build a product because you can never know when its _right_ time.

PS: Just to be abundantly clear, I'm not arguing that the folks over at Pretzel somehow stole
our idea, or undermine the work they've done. I'm using them to prove my point
about the fundamental relationship between time and startup success. On a side note,
I'm thrilled that they're taking on this challenge and their demo
is vastly more impressive than ours. I'm curious to see how far they can run with this
and I'll definitely be cheering them on along the way (the founders are both
ex-Stripes ðŸ‘€)
