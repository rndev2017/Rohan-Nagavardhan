*This summer, I continued working at Wander on a React Native mobile application 
for our iOS users. I built a product to scratch an itch with FitBit's food 
logging capabilities. And I started my first software engineering (SWE) 
internship at Comcast (Effectv), working on TV Ad-tech solutions.*

## Wander
Wander is a social media startup founded by University of Michigan alum 
[Justin Gainsley]("https://twitter.com/GainsleyJustin") and 
[Yash Ramachandani]("https://twitter.com/yash14700"). Wander was created on 
the premise that we form more meaningful connections with those that share 
the same interests/hobbies as us rather than the places we've been or 
the food that we've eaten.

### How is Wander different from X? 
Last summer, I ran into a high school friend of mine who was rising junior studying
Computer Science at Berkeley. We caught up and I told him I was working at 
social media startup called Wander. I explained the whole shtick: 
"Wander is a platform to allow people to discuss intellectual content with their 
network". Usually people just nod their heads and say "Oh, that's cool!", but 
he asked me a question I hadn't really thought about before: 
"How is Wander different from X?". After working at Wander for more than a year,
here is my answer.  

From my experience, social media apps are distinguished by how it allows
its users to generate content. For example, TikTok is the king of short-form
video, where most content averages around [~21-30](https://dot.la/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-2656809666.html) 
seconds. Snapchat capitalizes on the spontaneous nature of the world and lets you
upload raw footage of stuff going on around you. Instagram is a modern, digital 
version of an old photo album: you take all your pictures, and put them into 
mini albums or posts. Although Twitter _does_ allow posting photo 
and video content, its primary focus is on quick, directed, and 
concise user generated text. On the other hand, Wander emphasizes curation 
as a method of "generating" content. Here is my Wander feed.

From the UI, it is clear that Justin posted this, but the article is **not** written
by him. It's just a Medium article that he found, which compelled him to post it 
on Wander in the hopes of creating discourse. Every user is the content curator of
their own interests which makes Wander the best place discuss and develop your
interests on the internet. In my opinion, this is Wander's niche.  

### Web -> Mobile
In my experience, when you're starting to build an app, there's two routes that are 
open to you as the developer: mobile-first or web-first. For most use cases, I 
think a web-first approach is the way to go. You don't have to wait months to
launch (ðŸ‘€ App Store) which makes iterative development stupid simple, you can
still make your web app mobile-friendly with simple `media-queries`, and you can 
pick and choose from a large variety of web technologies. If your app grows and
you have the bandwidth to support both the mobile and web platform, you can always
make that addition.  

By early 2022, our web app had matured and we made the transition 
to developing our React Native mobile app exclusive to iOS (for now). 
Knowing React significantly improved my productivity, and it only took me a couple of 
sessions of focused development to start implementing features for the 
app. Even with the backend infrastructure already available, it was not an
easy lift and shift job. School and other distractions made it difficult to
iterate quickly, so I opted to start when I had more bandwidth. Few weeks into my
summer break, I implemented features such as in-app browsing, adding to unread/
collections/playlists, displaying notifications, and a functioning 
infinite scroll mechanism. Below is a brief demo of that work.
(Note: Most of the work you see in the video is by me!)

Overall, my first project with React Native was pretty fun. Being able to
build mobile applications with web technologies is super powerful and 
intuitive.

## FitBit Recipe Importer

From a bird's eye view, the Fitbit app is well-designed, and 
all the information you need is readily available at a glance. But, in my opinion, its 
macro/food tracking experience is subpar. I love trying online recipes in my 
free time, but I get super frustrated when it's time to track it because
I have to keep swapping between the recipe and the app and input each nutrient
one by one. At first glance, it seemed like a super cool engineering problem 
and decided that I would tackle it for fun.

### Approach #1
My initial approach was to build a web scraper to find where the nutritional 
information was in the HTML markup, extract it, and return the data in 
JSON format. This was a miserable experience. One of the biggest problems with 
this approach is no recipe blog is built the same. There is no consistency across pages, so 
one parsing method might work for a couple of sites, but wasn't a generic solution. 
So, I quickly abandoned this approach. 

### Approach #2
In my research, I found a 
[blog post](https://www.jedsimson.co.nz/blog/2020/06/04/parsing-ingredients-from-online-recipe-articles)
by Jed Simon who worked on exactly the same problem. He found out that recipe
blogs use a special type of metadata contained in a script tag with an `application\ld+json` 
type to provide Google's web crawlers all sorts of information about their recipe. This information
includes images of each step in the cooking process, step-by-step instructions, ingredients, 
prep/cook times, and so much more (full list [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/recipe)).
I decided that this was definitely the _best_ possible approach and started
building a prototype with this approach in mind.

**Sample `application\ld+json`**
```
  {
      "@context": "https://schema.org/",
      "@type": "Recipe",
      "name": "Party Coffee Cake",
      "image": [
        ...
      ],
      "author": {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Mary Stone"
      },
      "datePublished": "2018-03-10",
      "description": "This coffee cake is awesome and perfect for parties.",
      "prepTime": "PT20M",
      "cookTime": "PT30M",
      "totalTime": "PT50M",
      "keywords": "cake for a party, coffee",
      "recipeYield": "10",
      "recipeCategory": "Dessert",
      "recipeCuisine": "American",
      "nutrition": {
        "@type": "NutritionInformation",
        "calories": "270 calories"
      },
      "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 cups of flour",
        "3/4 cup white sugar",
        "2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt",
        "1/2 cup butter",
        "2 eggs",
        "3/4 cup milk"
        ],
      "recipeInstructions": [
        ...
      ]
    }
```

### MVP
A well-designed programming project is 80% planning and 20% coding. This was
the case here as well. The entire timeline was two weeks. I spent about a week
and a half planning, researching valid approaches, prototyping quick solutions,
and choosing which technolgies to use. The actual engineering was simple. 

On a side note, I decided to use this project to learn more about containers and Docker.
For this project, I spun up a container running my [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) 
REST API with a single endpoint with the path `/parse`. The `/parse` endpoint did the following things upon
recieving a request:
1. validate the link using regex
2. request the HTML markup of the link
3. find the `application\ld+json` script
4. validate the json
5. extract nutrition information and ingredients
6. construct response json

There were some hiccups with step 2, but I worked around that by using user-agent
spoofing and it worked like a charm! I used the BeautifulSoup library to deal with
the finding tags in the markup and then used basic Python to get the rest of 
the steps working.  

The frontend was built using `Vite + React` and styled with TailwindCSS. Within a couple 
of days, I wrapped up frontend development and had it working end-to-end. Below
is a demo of the app or you can check it out for yourself

The backend is deployed on Heroku and the frontend is deployed on Netlify. Both
services made it extremely easy to deploy my code and plus they had free tiers!

### Launch ðŸŽ‰
This project was motivated to scratch my own itch, but was curious if this 
was something other FitBit users were frustrated with as well. I've tried launching
projects through Reddit, but a huge problem with moderated subreddits are the
strict "no self-promotion" rules. Luckily, r/fitbit didn't have any restrictions.
I carefully wrote a post talking about the motivation for the project and linked a
quick demo (same as above) and a link for people to try it out. (Here is the 
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/v17sfp/fitbit_recipe_importer_a_simple_app_that_lets_you/))

The response was unimaginable. People were loving it! For the number nerds,
here are some metrics after launching.

#### Metrics
* Within 48 hours, the post recieved close to 60 upvotes and 10.6k views
* Within the first month, the site had nearly 200+ unique visitors
* Within three months, the site is closing in on 300 unique visitors

<p className="text-[0.8rem] text-neutral-400 italic">* Data provided by Netlify Analytics</p>

The code is far from perfect, and sometimes when I peek at the Heroku logs, 
I find `Internal Server Error`s every once in a while. I've been thinking of
enhancements over the past 3 months, but haven't had the time to start work on them
because of my internship. But hopefully I'll be able to start planning and working
on a v2 soon!

## Comcast 
This summer I worked as an engineering intern at Effectv which is one of 
two advertising companies within Comcast. My team worked in the ad delivery
space ensuring that the correct ads end up at the correct channels on time. 
During my 11 weeks, I had two roles: Scrum Master and Software Engineer. 
As the scrum master, I was responsible for conducting various Agile ceremonies 
such as Daily Standup and Sprint Retrospective. As a software engineer, I worked 
with other engineers maintaining and enhancing our core product called 
Enterprise Schedule & Verification Platform (or ESVP).

### Steel Cloud Migration
My first task involved redeploying two critical applications onto a new
server. One app was called "Server Restart Tool" which 
enabled engineers to remotely restart any server. It was built with Django and
deployed on a legacy web server tool called 
[Internet Information Services (IIS)](https://stackify.com/iis-web-server/). The
other was an Angular (ðŸ¤¢) application deployed using the same tool. This mini-project
was super tedious because work just involved copying over the files from one
Windows server to the other, and then spending hours configuring IIS. At the
time, it didn't seem like useful information, but exposure to IIS this early
helped me when I was working on PAA Monitor Tool towards the end of my internship.

### Test Driven Development 
After the app migration project, I spent about a week exploring Test Driven
Development (TDD) in Go by writing tests for common functions used by 
the ESVP codebase. The beauty of Go is that testing is built directly into the
language, there is absolutely *NO* configuration. All batteries are included.
Plus they have awesome test tooling to automatically calcuate code coverage and 
even visualize which parts of your code are being covered!!

ESVP is a huge codebase (~580,000 LOC) and a cool side effect of writing tests
early on in my internship was that it helped me understand the big picture. It significantly
helped me ramp up when I started adding enhancements to the codebase. I knew how
all the pieces fit together and working on tests gave me the oppurtunity to
dive deeper in to the code base. Although I hate writing tests, it ended up paying
dividends in my speed of code output. 

### My contributions to ESVP
#### AWS SAM CLI
ESVP has been running on premises (on servers directly owned and managed by Comcast) 
since its inception. Jetway is an effort to refactor ESVP 
to use AWS cloud infrastructure and eventually sunset on premises servers. One of the
first things I worked on was setting up a suite of tools to test lambdas locally.
Our team had used LocalStack in the past but many noted that it was hard to configure
for testing only a handful of endpoints. I discovered the AWS SAM CLI
from the AWS Documentation, experimented with it on my end, and wrote up a 
technical guide for setting up the AWS SAM CLI to work with Go and get our Lambda functions
running locally. This allowed our team to thoroughly test our backend before
ever pushing to production and made me way more productive while working on
Jetway.

#### CSV Exports/Imports
ESVP is used by over 300+ business users from Ad Operations teams and Sales
teams at Comcast which means that it handles an insane amount of data and traffic.
A typical workflow in ESVP will use CSV exports and imports with a huge number 
rows and columns. In order to handle this at scale, I helped build an integration
with AWS S3 to automatically detect large file sizes and use a presigned S3 url
instead of a typical multipart form request. I also transformed the UX of exporting
data from the platform. Before my changes, file downloads were slow, CSV header
orderings didn't match existing ESVP guidelines, and no data would result in 
the completely empty CSV file. To fix the file downloads, I standardized
our JSON response schema for CSV files, and rewrote our JSON -> CSV deserialization
to be 15% faster. Comcast's frontend was written completely in vanilla JS 
and HTML so our JS was chockful of `document.getElementByID` which was 
_definitely_ fun to read and maintain ðŸ¥². But, it did give me a far greater
appreciation for modern Javascript UI frameworks that abstract all of this 
away.

### `reload`
Developing apps in the Javascript ecosystem is blazingly fast, you keep the 
server running in the background and as soon as a file changes, you hit refresh, 
and your changes are there automagically. Since our Go apps are compiled, you can't
achieve live reload functionality out of the box. Here's an illustration of how 
development work was done on our Go apps. 

<img
  src="/images/summer_22/workflow_pre_reload.png"/>

There are existing solutions, but didn't have the tight integration with containers
I was looking for. Also, it was an oppurtunity to help the team be more productive
while learning more about Go. Here are the overarching goals of this project.

1. Has to work with both containerized and non-containerized applications
2. Has to be easily configurable
3. Has to be easy to use

In about two weeks of work, I created `reload`. Reload is a CLI tool written
in Golang to inject live reload functionality for both containerized and
non-containerized applications in hopes of streamlining developer productivity
and promoting rapid iterative development on all applications. I'm planning on
creating a little demo of the tool soon. (Stay posted ðŸ‘€) But for now, enjoy
this sweet screenshot.

### Pull Request Notifier
Half way through my internship, our team size decreased and we lost our only
QA engineer. We had to adapt and the engineering team assumed the role of QA'ing
each others features which dramatically reduced development capacity. A side effect 
of this adaptation was an increase in open, unreviewed pull requests. At several
points in time, we had like 15+ pull requests open without review. So I took initiative
and built Pull Request Notifier. It's a simple Slack app that queries GitHub
for open pull requests in our org and sends a helpful message to our Slack
channel telling our engineers to close out pull requests. Within a couple of days
of use we were able to reduce our open pull requests from 15+ to 5. Below is a
message sent after deployed into production.

<img
  src="/images/summer_22/pr_notifier.jpg"/>

### PAA Monitor Tool
Apart from ESVP, we own two other products called PAA and CSM. CSM is a legacy
Ad Delivery tool built in .NET and `C#` and PAA is an archive that handles
advertising during political campaigns (local, state, and national). Every day,
PAA handles importing data from the Operational Reporting team at Comcast.
Sometimes we haven't recieved any data from the OpRep team which could mean
two things: the team has not posted any new information, or the PAA job that is
meant to process this new data is not in a healthy state. But there is no way
of knowing this has even occurred without thorough investigation into the
database containing these records. So, the PAA Monitor tool was built as a
small dashboard for the Comcast business to keep track of the last known
OpRep data recieved and whether or not PAA had processed it. Here is a view
of that dashboard. 

<img
  src="/images/summer_22/paa.png"/>

The dashboard was built with ASP .NET Core v6 using Razor Pages. This was my
first exposure to building web applications using C# and it was refreshingly
different from what I'm used to. It's secured with Windows authentication 
which was a breeze to set up using IIS. It wasn't all smooth sailing, but 
learned new things about IIS and an entire new web framework.

Additionally, I built a background job using Go that would notify our team
with an email notification in the event of no OpRep data or PAA had
not processed the data by 9:00 AM.

### Conclusion

It wasn't until I sat down to write this blog post that I realized all the things
that I accomplished this summer. I don't know if I'm ready to start school again,
but I'm excited to see what the school year has in store for me.
