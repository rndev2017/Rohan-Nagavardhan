TOOD: Intro

I have a long history with photography. In ninth grade, my parents gifted me a telescope, and I dabbled a bit in astrophotography, rather unsuccessfully. Found out astrophotography was too hard, so I started taking pictures with my iPhone 5S. I went through the universal phase of taking a picture and then editing the fuck out of the photo because it looked "edgy" to my teenage brain. Soon after, photography and I parted our separate ways until December 2023. 



- Intro / Context
  - Need to come up with something to talk about at our ROX offsite (don't explicitely say ROX, you get the idea)
  - If I get to present, making a slide deck will pretty damn easy. If I don't, I'll get a pretty nice blog article out of it

- Journey to film photography
  - Polaroid (instant) -> Disposable (film) -> Italy
    - got the scans back, and fell in love with the medium (+ the relatively cheapness compared to Polaroid)

- Digital works just fine, right?
  
  - Constraints -> Challenge (segway into intention)
  - Intention (ties into being meticulous about craft and beauty, a Stripe operating principle)
  - Say No to Instant Gratification!
    - The results of your time shooting pictures takes time (it's not instant)
    - In a world where things are on demand, it's nice to step back and say no to instantaneity
  - Embrace the Unexpected (Serendipity)
    - both in photography and in life
    - life isn't a straight linear path, and neither is shooting with film
    - sometimes the pictures that I thought would come out the best, ended up being the worst of the roll (and you simply learn to accept it as a fact)

- My favorite photos

- Shameless Instagram plug
