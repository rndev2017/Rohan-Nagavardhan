I, recently, celebrated my first year at Stripe, and so I've been reflecting a ton on my growth as an engineer. I've attempted to document some of the important learnings from this past year.

### Seek Discomfort
I, _seriously_, think this was the single, biggest catalyst for my growth this year. 



### _"Jack of all trades, master of none"_ isn't always a bad thing
Key points:
1. Software systems aren't really built in isolation. It's more like a web of interconnected pieces of code.
2. You're a far more valuable engineer if you learn more about the adjacent pieces of code + your own systems rather than the just ur own systems
  Merchantilism analogy?
  Why? Projects are unlikely to be confined to your own system, if you take the time to learn about other systems at some point A, it's likely you'll use some reincarnation of that information again in a future project at point B.
  It can make you more self-sufficient and allows whatever project you're working on to be unblocked because you have a rough - decent understanding of the adjacent system.

Learning to read code is more valuable than knowing how to write it (Reading >> Writing)

Building in existing systems are valuable (Constraints)

Write technical docs just as much as you write code (Write, write, write)
### Write, write, write!
1. As a new grad engineer (NGE), your single biggest expectation is to write code. At Stripe, your entire performance is based on it
2. But 


Double down on your strengths, they give you space to work on ur weaknesses

### Words of Wisdom 
Below are two pieces of advice that I've recieved from two individuals with far more experience than me. I'm including them here because they helped _me_ reframe how to think about my career and its progression. 

#### Learn what kind of engineer you want to be.


#### Good Judgement


learn what kind of engineer you want to be, and unapologetically work on stuff that is in service of that goal

Learn good judgement / Exercise good judgement



On average, I've enjoyed the work I done at Stripe. Are there weeks where I absolutely dread having to go to work? Sure. But I know how painful it is to force yourself to work on stuff you don't enjoy, and I haven't yet felt that way at Stripe.
